        h2 Transportation

        p There are two main modes of widely used transportation in Amsterdam: public transportation and cycling. Both offer their own distinct advantages and both are simple and easy to use.

        h4 Public Transportation

        p Amsterdam utilizes the public transport chip card (OV-chipkaart) for travel on trams, buses, and metros. GVB day passes provide unlimited travel on the GVB network in Amsterdam (GVB buses, metros, and trams) for a set period of time (1-7 days). Seven day passes will provide the most use and are priced at 32 Euros.

        h4 Cycling

        p Biking provides a healthy, practical, and enjoyable mode of transportation. Amsterdam is extremely bike-friendly with a network of cycle routes and flat landscape. There are bike rentals all over, and for the purpose of safety, many establishments offer brightly-colored bikes to alert pedestrians.
