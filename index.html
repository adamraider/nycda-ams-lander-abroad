        <h2>Transportation</h2>
        <p>There are two main modes of widely used transportation in Amsterdam: public transportation and cycling. Both offer their own distinct advantages and both are simple and easy to use.</p>
        <h4>Public Transportation</h4>
        <p>Amsterdam utilizes the public transport chip card (OV-chipkaart) for travel on trams, buses, and metros. GVB day passes provide unlimited travel on the GVB network in Amsterdam (GVB buses, metros, and trams) for a set period of time (1-7 days). Seven day passes will provide the most use and are priced at 32 Euros.</p>
        <h4>Cycling</h4>
        <p>Biking provides a healthy, practical, and enjoyable mode of transportation. Amsterdam is extremely bike-friendly with a network of cycle routes and flat landscape. There are bike rentals all over, and for the purpose of safety, many establishments offer brightly-colored bikes to alert pedestrians.</p>

        <h2>Safety</h2>
        <p>Amsterdam is one of the top 25 safest cities in the world, with a much lower crime rate than many other popular European capitals. In large parts of the city, there are always at least a few people out and about, no matter whether it's Saturday night or Wednesday 3am in the morning.</p>
        <p>Students should be advised of dangers such as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Pickpockets</li>
          <li>Bag/Phone snatchers</li>
          <li>Getting hit by bikes</li>
          <li>Getting hit by trams</li>
